# tokenized_real_estate
This is a RWA prototype project I made for a private client.

This project implements a Tokenized Real Estate system on the Solana blockchain using Anchor. Each real estate asset (buildings, land, etc.) is represented as a tokenized asset, where individual tokens represent fractional ownership of the property.

## Features
1. Property Initialization:
- Create a new tokenized property with metadata (location, value, off-chain metadata URI).
- Property tokens (SPL tokens) represent fractional ownership.
2. Minting Property Shares:
  - Mint SPL tokens that represent property shares to an ownerâ€™s token account.
3.Transferring Property Shares:
  - Allows property share (SPL tokens) transfers between accounts.
