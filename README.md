# tokenized_real_estate
This is a RWA prototype project I made for a private client
This project implements a Tokenized Real Estate system on the Solana blockchain using Anchor. Each real estate asset (buildings, land, etc.) is represented as a tokenized asset, where individual tokens represent fractional ownership of the property.
